# Search

There is an addon recipe for Solr: [https://github.com/kanopi/saplings-solr](https://github.com/kanopi/saplings-solr)

This will configure solr search for the 2 content types that come with the base install. Pages and Posts. A view will be created that displays the content in a 4 column grid on desktop and a one column grid on mobile. Be sure to enable solr on your Pantheon instance for this to work correctly. In addition a stylized search form will display in the header of your site that opens in a modal.
